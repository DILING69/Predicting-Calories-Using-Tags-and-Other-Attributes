# Predicting-Calories-Using-Tags-and-Other-Attributes

In this project, we will attempt to **predeict the caloreis of a recipe** through **regression**. 

The response variable is the **calories** of each recipe. We chose to predict this variable because calories is a very straightforward and important indicator of the healthiness of a recipe and is especially important to people who are trying to loose weight (me).
